replicant - a repl for adb
==========================

`replicant` is an interactive shell (a [REPL][2]) for `adb`, the Android Debug Bridge.
It is partially based on Chris Wanstrath's excellent [repl][0] command line wrapper.

Overview
-------
Working with the `adb` tool directly to target connected emulators and devices is
verbose and cumbersome. `replicant` simplifies this process in a number of ways:

- being a repl, you're now working with `adb` in interactive mode
- allows fixing devices and package IDs for subsequent `adb` commands
- auto-detection of target package by project folder inspection
- command history and tab-completion via `rlwrap` (see below)

### Example
In this example session, we start `replicant` from the folder of an existing Android
application. It detects the manifest file and sets a default package ID.
From here on we list the available commands, fix the device to the first listed
emulator, uninstall the app, then reset the session.

     Type !list to see a list of commands.
     Commands not starting in '!' are sent to adb verbatim.
     Use Ctrl-D (i.e. EOF) to exit.

Install
-------
`replicant` requires Ruby 1.9 and a UNIX/Linux compatible shell such as `bash` or `zsh`.
For the best experience, I strongly recommend to install [rlwrap][1] to get
command history and tab-completion. `replicant` integrates with `rlwrap` automatically;
it's sufficient for it to just be installed.

To install, clone this repository then:

    $ cd replicant
    $ chmod 755 bin/replicant
    $ mkdir -p ~/bin/ && cd ~/bin
    $ ln -s <path/to/repo>/bin/replicant replicant

Make sure `~/bin` is in your `$PATH`.
