REPLicant -- repl for ADB
====================================

`replicant` is an interactive shell for ADB, the Android Debug Bridge,
originally based on @defunkt's excellent [repl][0]
command line wrapper.

Usage:

    $ replicant
    adb >> !package com.myapp
    Setting default package to "com.myapp"
    [com.myapp] adb >> !device emulator-5554
    Setting default device to "emulator-5554"
    [com.myapp] adb@emulator-5554 >> uninstall
    Success!
    [com.myapp] adb@emulator-5554 >> shell
    # ...
    [com.myapp] adb@emulator-5554 >> !reset
    adb >> ...
    .. etc ..

If you have [rlwrap][1] installed you'll automatically get the full
benefits of readline: history, reverse searches, etc.

e.g. `brew install rlwrap`

Install
-------

### Standalone

`replicant` is easily installed as a standalone script:

    export REPLICANT_BIN=~/bin/replicant
    curl -s https://raw.github.com/mttkay/replicant/latest/bin/replicant > $REPLICANT_BIN
    chmod 755 $REPLICANT_BIN

Change `$REPLICANT_BIN` to your desired location, just make
sure it's in your `$PATH`.

### RubyGems

Currently broken. Working on it.

`replicant` can also be installed as a RubyGem:

    $ gem install replicant
